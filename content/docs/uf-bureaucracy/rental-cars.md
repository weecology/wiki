UF faculty and staff can get discounted rates on rental cars for [personal](https://procurement.ufl.edu/contracts-2/rental-vehicles/) **and** [business](https://www.concursolutions.com/) purposes. The discount code is immediately applied when booking directly through UFGO (for business travel) or the Gator Perks (for personal travel) website. 

Graduate students can get the same discounted rates for [business purposes](https://procurement.ufl.edu/contracts-2/rental-vehicles/) **only**. A staff badge/ID is required upon pick up for employment verification. If not available, a letter from a department chair confirming the employment status of a graduate student can be used.
