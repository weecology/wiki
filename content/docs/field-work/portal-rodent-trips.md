## Pre-trip Preparations  

1. Add census dates to Portal Google calendar
2. Put together field crew.
   * During the summer months, a crew of 4 (including RA) is ideal for the rodent census. Portal plant census trips may benefit from more people.
   * "Local" volunteers (Tucson-based folks) sign up in this [form](https://forms.gle/6XXCzp5bUzgG6XNA9).
3. Submit the volunteer form for any new volunteers that need reimbursement or if you are purchasing any travel for them:
   * [WEC - POI Guest, Volunteer Request](https://nam10.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fforms.office.com%2FPages%2FResponsePage.aspx%3Fid%3D-KBNDTFKdk2s5gpiMx4bhGicOwDMKeFOrgQpJC5WLa1UQUIzSEtWT0tVUEY1SzVDUUsxQzJSSTM5TiQlQCN0PWcu&data=05%7C02%7Cgmyenni%40ufl.edu%7Cdbd63a14bb314ae5673408dd09a40e93%7C0d4da0f84a314d76ace60a62331e1b84%7C0%7C0%7C638677322405818577%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&sdata=GKm3AtiUgNKVMEqWksXO3pjI1DgrOdRVvNwhp7RIPW8%3D&reserved=0)

## Portal-Rodeo

Remember you are on the AZ-NM border, and they are in separate time zones half the year. NM is MDT/MST, while AZ is always MST. Keep the clock in the truck on AZ time, then you never have to change it. Phones usually are on NM time, but it can depend on the carrier and where you are standing. There is a digital alarm clock in the truck you can use so you have a consistent time piece for waking up in the morning. Portal and everything up Cave Creek Canyon operates on AZ time. Sky Island Grill, the Chiricahua Desert Museum and Rodeo are on NM time. 

We are starting to get some useful resources in the Portal-Rodeo area. 

[Portal-Rodeo community](https://portal-rodeo.com/)

[Friends of Cave Creek Canyon](https://www.friendsofcavecreekcanyon.com/)

[Portal Store](https://www.portallodge.com/)

You will need a lot of firewood to keep your volunteers warm and happy through the winter. To get a supply for the whole winter, go to the Portal Store and ask for the number of who is currently delivering firewood, or it will be posted there or at the Library. Some will deliver, or you can pick it up in town. Use your per diem, do not put it on your P Card!

## Rodent Census 

  A Portal weekend consists of two nights of rodent trapping. We drive down to the site no later than mid-day (can be a bit later during the summer). The drive is ~3 hrs long. Once we get there, we set camp and just before sunset we'll set traps on 12 plots (refer to trapping map in Dropbox to determine which plots are set on the first and second night), which takes about 2 hours. 
    
  The GoalZero battery, which we use to charge our electronic devices and power the camp lights, need to be set-up/charged using the solar panel. Prop the solar panel up in the small mound next to the ramada, and make sure it is facing the sun (You may need to adjust it throughout the day). Connect the wire to the extension cord and plug the extension cord to the GoalZero battery. Make sure that the green light in the charger plug is on. It is ideal that the camp lights and the stove are also set up before heading out to the plots. 
    
  When out setting traps on Day 1, the RA can opt to visit the locations of the camera traps and collect/replace the SD cards and/or replace batteries (Note: labels on the SD cards refer to the location of the camera trap. Ex. 21 west means it is the SD card used for the camera trap located on the west side of the plot NOT where it is facing). Camera traps are currently at the east and west side of the gates on plots 11 and 21. 
    
  The next day, we get up just before dawn, get a light breakfast, and head out to the plots. We process animals in the plots so make sure to pack water and snacks ("exiled" rodents are taken out of the site). The RA will be the one actually handling the animals while the volunteer records data and assists with equipment. Volunteers can handle "exiled" rodents if they are interested. 
    
  Later in the afternoon/early evening, we'll set traps on the other half of the plots (n=12). The next morning will be the same as previous, where we process rodents in the plots. No later than mid-day, we'll break camp, the RA collects data from the weather station, and then, we head back to Tucson. 

## Guides

The following rodent trapping-related field guides are in the Portal Dropbox for you to study. Also keep hard copies in the field to reference:

* Dropbox/Portal/FieldGuides/Smammal_trapping_protocol.doc: instructional guide on the trap setting and data collection protocol  
* Dropbox/Portal/FieldGuides/Trapping_map.pptx: a diagram of the plot locations and the trapping schedule (i.e., details on which plots you need to set traps in on each day, and where trap boxes need to be moved to for the second day of trapping)  
* Dropbox/Portal/FieldGuides/Rodent_ID_cards.pdf: descriptive field guide on all the rodent species recorded on site. Use when uncertain about the identity of the animal on hand
* Dropbox/Portal/FieldGuides/Sexing_Rodents.pdf: descriptive field guide to the correct sexing of rodent species  

## Post-trip Duties 

1. Check millet supply. If low, schedule a trip to a pet store. [OK Feed and Pet Supply](https://okfeedaz.com/) sells a 50 lbs bag of white millet for ~$30. Use PCard to pay for it.
2. Clean inside of field truck.
    * Drain cooler. Leave lid slightly ajar and crack open window of the bed of the truck to to vent it. 
    * Set-up the solar panel so that the GoalZero battery gets charged. Place the solar panel in the dashboard horizontally and plug the wire to the GoalZero battery. (If the battery isn't charge well, you can bring it in the hotel room and charge it first).
    * Drop off field truck at the off airport poarking lot. **Remember to take a photo of the stub/card they give you in the free shuttle.** 
3. Complete Travel
    * Submit receipts of PCard purchases (lodging, baggage, fuel, field gear, trapping supplies, etc.) using the [PCard Receipt Submision Form](https://wec.ifas.ufl.edu/resources/ufgo-pcard-forms/)

Note: You have until the fifth day of the next month to submit the log from the previous month.
    * Submit a [Travel Expense Report](https://wec.ifas.ufl.edu/resources/ufgo-travel-forms/) for yourself and all non-UF travelers within a week of returning from the trip.
    * Send the [Travel Expense Report](https://wec.ifas.ufl.edu/resources/ufgo-travel-forms/) to all UF travelers and remind them to submit.

## Plant Census 

  We conduct plant census trips twice a year: Once in the winter (around late March/early April) and once in the summer (around late August/early September). The dates vary based on its proximity to the new moon date of those months because we also do rodent census during this trip. Ideally, this is conducted with atleast 4 people. Usually, we stay at the site for 1 week during these trips. During the winter plant census, we only do quadrats. During the summer, we do BOTH transect and quadrats. Sampling protocol described [here](https://github.com/weecology/PortalData/blob/main/SiteandMethods/Methods.md). Allocation of the time for each task (rodent/plant data collection) can vary depending upon your arrival time on site and weather. It is recommended that site maintenance be done during this trip (e.g., fix trap boxes, fix gates, stomp out holes within 1m of the fences, clearing trails, etc.).  

## Some other things to keep in mind

* You can let volunteers know they don't need to bring anything (coffee, snacks, plates, utensils, first aid, etc.) unless they want to. We take care of all food and most supplies.
* Also warn volunteers this is a rustic camping situation, meaning no bathroom facilities and no water supply except what we bring in. We have several large jugs we can fill for drinking and washing dishes, but they may want to bring wet wipes or other personal hygeine supplies to be comfortable.
* It may be quite cold in December - February (it has been known to freeze overnight)
* It will definitely be quite hot in May - August
* There is somewhat limited cell reception at the site, depending on your carrier
* We camp out in the desert. The bed of the truck is spacious enough to fit 2 tall people. The back seat inside the truck can also be used but will only be comfortable for those under 5'4". There is an extra 2-person tent in the truck that anyone can use. Anyone is welcome to bring/set up a tent  near the ramada, there are a few established spots.
