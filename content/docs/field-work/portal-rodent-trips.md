## Pre-trip Preparations:  

1. Put together field crew. During the summer, crew of 4 (including RA) is ideal. "Local" volunteers (Tucson-based folks) sign up in this [form](https://forms.gle/6XXCzp5bUzgG6XNA9).
2. Submit necessary volunteer paperwork to WEC-HR (if-svc-wechr@mail.ufl.edu) and CC Administrative Services Manager (currently, Donna Dyer (dkb@ufl.edu)) and WEC Fiscal (wecfiscal@ifas.ufl.edu):
   * [Record of Volunteer Service](https://chp.phhp.ufl.edu/wordpress/files/2019/07/Record-of-Volunteer-Service.pdf)
   * [Volunteer Appointment Request](https://wec.ifas.ufl.edu/media/wecifasufledu/files/personnel/POI-VOLUNTEER-UFID-Request-Form-Fillable.pdf). Supervisor is the RA. Volunteers (even if they are grad students at UF) should choose the status: VOLUNTEER. Local physical (work site) address is: BLM land, Desert Willow Rd, Cochise County, AZ).
   * [Supervisor Checklist](https://webfiles.ehs.ufl.edu/jobduty.pdf). Choose None of the above duties apply, and have Glenda sign it. Form can be reused for multiple volunteers and trips.
4. File a [blanket travel request](https://wec.ifas.ufl.edu/resources/ufgo-travel-forms/). Choose Option 2 and fill the form accordingly.
5. Book flights and lodging for all non-Tucson based field crew members using [UFGO](https://www.concursolutions.com/home.asp).
6. (*Optional*) A week before travel, reach out to volunteers to get food/drink requests and order groceries online (e.g., Walmart), and just do a pick-up the day you drive down to the site.
7. Pick up field truck in the [long-term parking lot](https://airportparkingtucson.com/location/lot-2/). Use the PCard to pay for it.
8. (*Optional*) Fill water containers (in Watermill Express or other refilling stations) and get gas (You might also want to grab logs in gas stations during the winter).
   
## Trip Details

A Portal weekend consists of two nights of rodent trapping. We drive down to the site no later than mid-day (can be a bit later during the summer). The drive is ~3 hrs long. Once we get there, we set camp and just before sunset we'll set traps on 12 plots (refer to trapping map in Dropbox to determine which plots are set on the first and second night), which takes about 2 hours. The GoalZero battery, which we use to charge our electronic devices and power the camp lights, need to be set-up/charged using the solar panel. Prop the solar panel up in the small mound next to the ramada, and make sure it is facing the sun (You may need to adjust it throughout the day). Connect the wire to the extension cord and plug the extension cord to the GoalZero battery. Make sure that the green light in the charger plug is on. It is ideal that the camp lights and the stove are also set up before heading out to the plots. When out setting traps on Day 1, the RA can opt to visit the locations of the camera traps and collect/replace the SD cards and/or replace batteries (Note: labels on the SD cards refer to the location of the camera trap. Ex. 21 west means it is the SD card used for the camera trap located on the west side of the plot NOT where it is facing). Camera traps are currently at the east and west side of the gates on plots 11 and 21. The next day, we get up just before dawn, get a light breakfast, and head out to the plots. We process animals in the plots so make sure to pack water and snacks ("exiled" rodents are taken out of the site). The RA will be the one actually handling the animals while the volunteer records data and assists with equipment. Volunteers can handle "exiled" rodents if they are interested. Later in the afternoon/early evening, we'll set traps on the other half of the plots (n=12). The next morning will be the same as previous, where we process rodents in the plots. No later than mid-day, we'll break camp, the RA collects data from the weather station, and then, we head back to Tucson. 

## Things to pack:

* truck keys
* PIT tag reader
* PIT tags
* weather station Surface Pro
* rodent data sheets 
* sleeping bag (and sleeping pad, though we have some extras in the truck)
* headlamp
* hiking boots
* field clothes (Note that there are lots of thorny plants at the site)
* hat/sunglasses (for shade from the sun, and also for the chilly evenings/mornings)
* water bottle
* rain jacket
* chapstick
* (*Optional*) something to keep yourself occupied during down time (book, music, etc.)
* (*Optional*) tent
  
## Some other things to keep in mind:

* We take care of all the food and related items (volunteers don't need to bring coffee, snacks, plates, utensils, etc. unless they want to)
* This is a rustic camping situation, meaning no bathroom facilities and no water supply except what we bring in (we have several large jugs we can fill for drinking and washing dishes).  
* It may be quite cold in December - February (it has been known to freeze overnight)
* It will definitely be quite hot in May - August
* There is somewhat limited cell reception at the site, depending on your carrier
* If you love plants, consider coming down for our week-long plant censuses in late March/early April and late August/early September
* We camp out in the desert. The bed of the truck is spacious enough to fit 2 tall people. The back seat inside the truck can also be used but it may not be as spacious. However, anyone is welcome to bring/set up a tent  near the ramada. There is an extra 2-person tent in the truck that anyone can use.

## Post-trip Duties: 

* Clean inside of field truck, and make sure cooler is drained. Keep the lid slightly ajar and crack open window of the bed of the truck to to vent it. Set-up the solar panel so that the battery gets charged. Place the solar panel in the dashboard horizontally and plug the wire to the GoalZero battery. If you are staying in a hotel before heading out, bring the battery and charge it inside the hotel room but make sure you bring it back to the truck before you leave. 
* Drop off field truck at the [long-term parking lot](https://airportparkingtucson.com/location/lot-2/). Remember to take a photo of the stub/card they give you in the free shuttle. 
* Submit receipts of PCard purchases (lodging, baggage, fuel, field gear, trapping supplies, etc.) using the [PCard Receipt Submision Form](https://wec.ifas.ufl.edu/resources/ufgo-pcard-forms/)
* Fill in [mileage log](https://wec.ifas.ufl.edu/media/wecifasufledu/files/Vehicle-Use-Record-Mileage.pdf) and send to WEC Operations Manager (currently, Cameron Carter (ccriderr@ufl.edu)) and CC WEC Fiscal (wecfiscal@ifas.ufl.edu). Note: You have until the fifth day of the next month to submit the log from the previous month.
* Submit a [Travel Expense Report](https://wec.ifas.ufl.edu/resources/ufgo-travel-forms/) for all travellers within a week of returning from the trip.
* Scan data sheets and deposit on Portal Dropbox folder: Portal -> PORTAL_primary_data -> Rodent -> Raw_data -> datasheet_scans -> year. Make sure to rename file to appropriate census period.
* Enter data and have field technician do the second entry.
  * Open folder with .xls files of the rodent data: Portal -> PORTAL_primary_data -> Rodent -> Raw_data -> New_data. Copy a previous one, and rename file with the appropriate census date (Ex. newdatXX.xlsx).
  * Enter rodent data on DE1 tab (field technician enters data on DE2 tab).
    - When filling in the year, encode full year value (Ex. Encode 2024 instead of 24).
    - When dragging down repetitive values (e.g., month, day, year, plot), make sure that the values are copied over in the target cells (i.e., make sure that when you drag down, the values are not increasing).
    - Use all caps in all columns.
    - Under the tag column, the usual values are 6-characters long. The characters range from numbers 0-9 and letters A-E.
    - In rows where individuals got *new tags*, put an asterisk (*) under note2.
    - Notes of individuals being dead (D), released (R), or escaped (E) should be put under the column note5.	
* Download PIT tags (Note: You need a Windows machine with BioTerm installed. The weather station laptop works.)
  * Connect the scanner using the USB adapter.
  * Open BioTerm. Make sure the BAUD rate is 9600. Select Open.
  * Using the scanner, press READ, then MENU until it says "Downloaded tags". Press the down arrow, then READ. It will ask if you want to send all tags. Press READ. The tags *should* appear in the BioTerm text box. You may need to squeeze the adapter into the scanner so you get a really secure connection (the screw is really difficult to turn all the way). In theory you can also type "G" into the BioTerm text box and the tags will appear, but Renata has mixed success with this.
  * Save the newtags (tags-censusnumber.txt) in the Portal Dropbox folder.
* QA the rodent data and push a PR to update the [PortalData repo](https://github.com/weecology/PortalData).
  * In GitHub (remote):
    - create new branch and rename it to: rodents_censusperiod (Make sure you are in the correct repo: PortalData).
    - clone the repo by following the instructions [here](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository). Note: You only need to do this once.
  * In R (local):
    - Click File -> New Project -> Existing Directory and browse to where PortalData is saved in your computer and open it
    - In the terminal tab in R, type:
      * git pull (to make sure that you have the latest version of the files)
      *  git checkout rodents_censusperiod (make sure you are working on the new brach you just created)  
    - In the Files tab in R, go to PortalData -> DataCleaningScipts, and click on new_rodent_data.r.
    - Run code from lines 1 to 11, and update line 18 to the correct census period number.
      Note: If you are using a Windows Machine:
      *  line 20 (filepath= "") should have 2 back slashes after each location (Ex.: filepath= D:\\Dropbox\\Portal\\PORTAL_primary_data\\Rodent\\Raw_data\\New_data)
      * line 22 (newfile=""), there should be 2 back slashesbefore the word newdat (Ex.: paste(filepath, '\\newdat', newperiod, '.xlsx', sep = ''))
      * line 23 (scannerfile=""), there should be 2 back slashes before the phrase tag scans and tags (Ex.: paste(filepath, '\\tag scans\\tags', newperiod, '.txt', sep = ''))  
    - Run line 29. Corect the .xlsx worksheets until they match.
    - Once the sheets are identical, run lines 36 to 38. If errors pop up, update Excel file and note changes in the red notebook.
    - Run subsequent lines and make necessary changes. Note them in red notebok. This is so we can track the decisions on the species/sex/etc. IDs that were made.
    - Save R file.
    - Check if the moon_dates.csv file is updated to the latest census date. (location: PortalData -> Rodents -> moon_dates.csv). Update manually if does not.
    - Once done, push to GitHub repo by clicking on the Git tab in R, and checking the files that were updates (Usually, this includes 2 files: new_rodent_data.r and Portal_rodent.csv).
      - make sure to write an intuitive commit message. Ex.: add rodent census XXX data [minor]).
  * In Github:
    - Go to the Weecology PortalData repo and click the message that says a new commit has been pushed by you.
    - Create a pull request by clicking the create pull request button at the bottom of that page. Tag Glenda as a reviewer before doing so.
    - If it passes all checks/tests,you're good to go! If not, go to the PR (pull request) page and read the details where the error occurred. Fix issues accordingly.
* Download camera trap photos, and deposit on the lab T: drive. Deposit in the appropriate folders: portal_cameras-> year_folder(Ex. 2024)-> year-month_folder (Ex. 2024-05) -> location. Use The Reconyx Buckview Software (already in the Surface Pro) to go through the photos before depositing in the drive.
