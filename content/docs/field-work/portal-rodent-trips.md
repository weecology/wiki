## Pre-trip Preparations (for RA):  

1. Put together field crew. During the summer, crew of 4 (including RA) is ideal. "Local" volunteers (Tucson-based folks) sign up in this [form](https://forms.gle/6XXCzp5bUzgG6XNA9).
2. Submit necessary volunteer paperwork to WEC-HR (if-svc-wechr@mail.ufl.edu) and CC Donna Dyer (dkb@ufl.edu) and WEC Fiscal (wecfiscal@ifas.ufl.edu):
   * [Record of Volunteer Service](https://chp.phhp.ufl.edu/wordpress/files/2019/07/Record-of-Volunteer-Service.pdf)
   * [Volunteer Appointment Request](https://wec.ifas.ufl.edu/media/wecifasufledu/files/personnel/POI-VOLUNTEER-UFID-Request-Form-Fillable.pdf). Supervisor is the RA. Volunteers (even if they are grad students at UF) should choose the status: VOLUNTEER. Local physical (work site) address is: BLM land, Desert Willow Rd, Cochise County, AZ).
   * [Supervisor Checklist](https://webfiles.ehs.ufl.edu/jobduty.pdf). Choose None of the above duties apply, and have Glenda sign it. Form can be reused for multiple volunteers and trips.
4. File a [blanket travel request](https://wec.ifas.ufl.edu/resources/ufgo-travel-forms/). Choose Option 2 and fill the form accordingly.
5. Book flights and lodging for all non-Tucson based field crew members using [UFGO](https://www.concursolutions.com/home.asp).
6. (*Optional*) A week before travel, reach out to volunteers to get food/drink requests and order groceries online (e.g., Walmart), and just do a pick-up the day you drive down to the site.
7. Pick up field truck as soon as you arrive in the [long-term parking lot](https://airportparkingtucson.com/location/lot-2/). Use the PCard to pay for it.
   
## Trip Details

A Portal weekend consists of two nights of rodent trapping. We drive down to the site no later than mid-day (can be a bit later during the summer). The drive is ~3 hrs long. Once we get there, we set camp and just before sunset we'll set traps on 12 plots (refer to trapping map in Dropbox to determine which plots are set on the first and second night), which takes about 2 hours. The next day, we get up just before dawn and process animals in the plots ("exiled" rodents are taken out of the site). The RA will be the one actually handling the animals while the volunteer records data and assists with equipment. Volunteers can handle "exiled" rodents if they are interested. Later in the afternoon/early evening, we'll set traps on the other half of the plots (n=12). The next morning will be the same as previous, where we process rodents in the plots. No later than mid-day, we'll break camp, the RA collects data from the weather station and collects the SD cards and/or replaces batteries on the camera traps (currently at the east and west side of the gates on plots 11 and 21), and then, we head back to Tucson.

## Things to pack ( those with * are to be brought by the RA):

* PIT tag reader*
* PIT tags*
* weather station Surface Pro* 
* Sleeping bag (and sleeping pad, though we have some extras in the truck)
* Headlamp
* Hiking boots
* Field pants (lots of thorny plants at the site)
* Clothes 
* Long sleeve shirt for sun protection
* Hat/sunglasses (for shade from the sun, and also for the chilly evenings/mornings)
* Water bottle
* Rain jacket
* Chapstick
* Something to keep yourself occupied during down time (book, music, etc.)
  
## Some other things to keep in mind:

* We take care of all the food and related items (volunteers don't need to bring coffee, snacks, plates, utensils, etc. unless they want to)
* This is a rustic camping situation, meaning no bathroom facilities and no water supply except what we bring in (we have several large jugs we can fill for drinking and washing dishes).  
* It may be quite cold in December - February (it has been known to freeze overnight)
* It will definitely be quite hot in May - August
* There is somewhat limited cell reception at the site, depending on your carrier
* If you love plants, consider coming down for our week-long plant censuses in late March/early April and late August/early September

## Post-trip Duties (for RA): 

* Clean inside of field truck, and make sure cooler is drained. Set-up the solar panel so that the battery gets charged. 
* Drop off field truck at the [long-term parking lot](https://airportparkingtucson.com/location/lot-2/). Remember to take a photo of the stub/card they give you in the free shuttle. 
* Submit receipts of PCard purchases (lodging, baggage, fuel, field gear, trapping supplies, etc.) using the [PCard Receipt Submision Form](https://wec.ifas.ufl.edu/resources/ufgo-pcard-forms/)
* Fill in [mileage log](https://wec.ifas.ufl.edu/media/wecifasufledu/files/Vehicle-Use-Record-Mileage.pdf) and send to Cameron Rider (ccriderr@ufl.edu) and CC WEC Fiscal (wecfiscal@ifas.ufl.edu). 
* Submit a [Travel Expense Report](https://wec.ifas.ufl.edu/resources/ufgo-travel-forms/) for all travellers within a week of returning from the trip.
* Scan data sheets and deposit on Portal Dropbox folder.
* Enter data and have field technician do the second entry.
* Download PIT tags (Note: You need a Windows machine with BioTerm installed. The weather station laptop works.)
  * Connect the scanner using the USB adapter.
  * Open BioTerm. Make sure the BAUD rate is 9600. Select Open.
  * Using the scanner, press READ, then MENU until it says "Downloaded tags". Press the down arrow, then READ. It will ask if you want to send all tags. Press READ. The tags *should* appear in the BioTerm text box. You may need to squeeze the adapter into the scanner so you get a really secure connection (the screw is really difficult to turn all the way). In theory you can also type "G" into the BioTerm text box and the tags will appear, but Renata has mixed success with this.
  * Save the newtags (tags-censusnumber.txt) in the Portal Dropbox folder.
* Download camera trap photos, and deposit on the lab T: drive.
* QA the data and push a PR to update the [PortalData repo](https://github.com/weecology/PortalData).
