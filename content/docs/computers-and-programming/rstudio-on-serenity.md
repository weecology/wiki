  How to use RStudio remotely on the lab server
---
   
We have a lab server which is fairly powerful. It has 32GB of RAM and a 2 core Intel Xeon processor. This is faster and has more ram than any of our laptops. It's good for doing things that may take too long on a desktop/laptop or as a test bed for running on the hipergator.  

Note you must be on campus to use serenity, or logged in via the VPN. 

## Using RStudio
Open a browser and go to http://serenity.ifas.ufl.edu:8787 and login with your serenity username and password.   
This runs exactly like RStudio on your desktop. You'll have to re-install any packages that you need.
This works great for code that takes a long time to run. You can start something, then close the browser and Rstudio will keep running on serenity. 

## Getting a login
Ask Shawn or Henry for a username and initial password
