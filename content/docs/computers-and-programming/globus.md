[Globus](https://app.globus.org) is a useful file manager for transferring files between your computer and the HiPerGator, or from place to place on the HiPerGator.

[Here is the HiPerGator guide to Globus.](https://help.rc.ufl.edu/doc/Globus) It may be more up to date.

Briefly, to use Globus, you need to create an account with your UF login. You may need to get authorization to be added to the UF research computing access. Once you have access, you can use the online Globus interface to set up file transfers from different locations (called "endpoints") on the HiPerGator.

To transfer files to and from your computer, you need to install the Globus Connect Personal account on your computer and set it up as an "endpoint". Then you can also set up transfers to and from your computer.
