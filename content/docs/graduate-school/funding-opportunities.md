  Fellowship and grant opportunities for graduate students
---

You will typically enter the lab with guaranteed funding from a combination of Research Assistantships (RAs; to work on grant funded research), Teaching Assistantships (TAs; helping to teach college courses), and University Fellowships (conceptually support to work on your own research, but at UF these typically also include a TA requirement).
If students are interested there are additional opportunities to apply for fellowships that can allow you to focus more directly your research projects.
