## Fun things to do visit Gainesville

###  In town  
* Natural History Museum / Butterfly Rainforest  
Entrance to the museum is free, you only have to pay for the Butterflies or temporary exhibits. Butterfly Rainforest fee is $13/6 for adults/kids. Current UFL students get in for free.   
* Paynes Prairie State Park  
La Chua trail on the East side of town is where the large alligators are. Lake access, trails, and a lookout tower are on the West side. Bison are usually on the West side.  
* Devil's Millhopper State Park  
Large sink hole with 200 step staircase going down into it. A short nature trail surrounding it. Worth seeing but probably not for more than an hour or so. 
* Sweetwater Wetlands Park  
Man-made wetland with boardwalk nature trails. Scarcely-shaded so ideal to visit early in the morning or late in the afternoon.

### Outside of town
* Goethe State Forest
expansive state land, good for hikes and birding
* St. Augustine.  
A nice beach, historic fort & downtown.  
* Springs  
Numerous springs around Gainesville worth a visit. Most are state parks and have an entrance fee. See a map [here](http://www.floridasprings.org/visit/map/).
